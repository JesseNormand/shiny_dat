# process behavior charts
This app is demonstrating the utilization of process behavior charts for a business process. In this example we are measuring units sold for over a unit of time. 
R has a great control package "qcc" to efficiently spin up X-bar and mR charts. 
In this demonstration I created an interactive app to show how the process may be affected given the new data input.
